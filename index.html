                        <p>Hello! I'm a passionate developer with experience in building web applications. I love coding and learning new technologies. I am also an experienced writer and researcher. I am a seasoned writer and researcher with seven years experience in academic writing. I have a Communications degree (with a Swahili major) from Moi University, but hope to venture into the Medical or Legal field soon. As a writing expert, I have written content in a wide array of fields including Nursing, Sociology, Business, Economics, Law and Government, Biology, History, Philosophy, Psychology, Literature, Religious Studies, Political Science, Music, and English. I have done research pieces, reports, analysis essays, outlines, literature reviews, critical thinking write-ups, and annotated bibliographies. My years of experience allow me to know the importance of thorough research for every writing piece, which, I learned, boils down to choosing the correct search terms and knowing how to identify credible sources.
                        Feed your eyes to my amazing writing sample that is just the tip of the iceberg!</p>

                <h3>Project 1</h3>
                <p>This was a simple project I did to boost my knowledge on how marketing works. At the same time, I was targetting a business-minded audience. As you can tell from he contents, I wrote it professionally and meticulously. I did thorough research and gave my audience adequate points of reference for better perspoective.</p>

                <h3>Project 2</h3>
                <p>This is a technical paper I wrote recently as part of my job at the International Association of Professional Writers and Editors (IAPWE). I compared three 2025 hybrid car models to the Tesla Model 3. Do not be fooled by the length of the article as this paper was tasking. Finding accurate details on each car model took me ages! However, my committment to excellence kept me going. In the end, I was glad I took up the challenge.</p>
